## 1. Scope of the Ideal MHD Model
Ideal MHD is used to assess the "lowest level" of stability for magnetized plasmas. While it assumes the plasma is collisional, it effectively describes macroscopic perpendicular dynamics (cross-field behavior).

* **Strengths:** It is a closed system that allows for the study of complex non-linear effects.
* **Limitations:** It is a poor descriptor of dynamics parallel to the magnetic field in collisionless plasmas, as these occur too rapidly for the model.
* **Marginal Stability:** Near marginal stability (small growth rates), plasma motions are considered incompressible.

## 2. Conservation of Flux (Frozen-in Law)
In the Ideal limit (resistivity $\eta = 0$), the magnetic field topology is invariant.

* **Ideal Ohm’s Law:** Defined as $E + u \times B = 0$.
* **Physical Intuition:** Magnetic field lines are conceptually "frozen" into the plasma fluid.
* **Mechanism:** The flux linking a loop moving with the fluid velocity is constant, meaning the fluid and field lines must move together.

## 3. Equilibrium Force Balance
Static equilibrium ($u = 0$) requires the Lorentz force to balance the pressure gradient:
$$J \times B = \nabla P$$

* **Isobaric Surfaces:** Magnetic field lines ($B \cdot \nabla P = 0$) and current lines ($J \cdot \nabla P = 0$) lie on surfaces of constant pressure.
* **Flux Surfaces:** In a tokamak, these constant pressure surfaces are known as flux surfaces.
* **Toroidal Topology:** The "Hairy Ball" theorem states that only a toroidal surface can be covered by a non-vanishing vector field like $B$ and $J$.

## 4. The Grad-Shafranov Equation (GSE)
The GSE is a non-linear, second-order elliptic partial differential equation that describes axisymmetric toroidal equilibria.

$$\Delta^* \psi = -R^2 \frac{dP(\psi)}{d\psi} - F(\psi) \frac{dF(\psi)}{d\psi}$$

### Key Components to Understand:
* **Poloidal Flux ($\psi$):** A stream function used to represent field components in the poloidal plane.
* **Free Functions:** To solve the GSE, one must prescribe the pressure profile $P(\psi)$ and the toroidal field/current function $F(\psi) = RB_\phi$.
* **The Operator ($\Delta^*$):** Defined as $R^2 \nabla \cdot (\frac{1}{R^2} \nabla)$ or, in cylindrical coordinates, $R \frac{\partial}{\partial R}(\frac{1}{R} \frac{\partial}{\partial R}) + \frac{\partial^2}{\partial Z^2}$.

## 5. Solving the Equilibrium Problem
The essence of the problem is solving for the locations of constant $\psi$ surfaces over the $(R, Z)$ plane.

* **Fixed Boundary:** Defining $\psi$ on a closed contour, often assuming the boundary is a perfect conductor where $\psi$ is constant.
* **Free Boundary:** Involves specifying flux in the vacuum region and accounting for external coil currents.
* **Iteration:** Realistic free boundary problems require iterative procedures because the plasma current distribution depends on the resulting equilibrium shape.
