## 1. Equilibrium Inputs and Outputs
A tokamak equilibrium is generated by providing specific profiles and boundary conditions to the Grad-Shafranov Equation (GSE). 

* **Inputs:** Pressure profiles $P(r)$, current function profiles $F(r)$ or safety factor profiles $q(r)$, and the magnetic flux $\psi$ on a fixed boundary $(R, Z)$.
* **Outputs:** Poloidal flux $\psi(r)$, magnetic field strength $B(r, \theta)$, and current density $J(r, \theta)$.


## 2. Straight Field Line Coordinates
Straight field line coordinates $(r, \theta, \phi)$ are essential for stability analysis because the local field pitch $q_l$ is constant on each flux surface ($q_l = q$).

* **Jacobian:** In this system, the Jacobian $\mathcal{J}_\theta$ is proportional to $R^2$, specifically $\mathcal{J}_\theta = \frac{r R^2}{R_0}$.
* **Safety Factor Relation:** The safety factor $q(r)$ relates to the flux through the identity $q(r) = \frac{r F(r)}{R_0 \psi'}$.

## 3. Aspect Ratio Expansion of the GSE
To solve the GSE analytically, R and Z are Fourier-expanded in terms of the inverse aspect ratio $\epsilon = r/R_0$.

* **The Expansion:** 
    * $R(r, \omega) = R_0(1 + \epsilon \cos \omega - \epsilon^2 \frac{\Delta(r)}{R_0} + ...)$ 
    * $Z(r, \omega) = R_0(\epsilon \sin \omega - ...)$ 
* **Harmonic Equations:** Substituting these into the GSE yields decoupled equations for different Fourier components:
    * **$\cos(0\omega)$:** Describes the balance between plasma pressure and magnetic pressure.
    * **$\cos(\omega)$:** Yields the radial equation for the **Shafranov Shift** ($\Delta$).
    * **$\cos(m\omega)$:** Yields equations for cross-section **shaping** (elongation and triangularity).

## 4. The Shafranov Shift ($\Delta$)
The Shafranov Shift represents the outward displacement of magnetic surfaces due to toroidal effects.

* **Drivers:** It is driven by the **Tyre Tube Force** (plasma pressure) and the **Hoop Force** (toroidal current).
* **Governing Equation:** $\Delta'(r) = \frac{r}{R_0} [\beta_p(r) + \frac{l_i(r)}{2}]$, where $\beta_p$ is poloidal beta and $l_i$ is internal inductance.
* **Stability:** A large Shafranov shift typically indicates high pressure gradients and can significantly affect MHD stability criteria.


## 5. Plasma Shaping Coefficients
Shaping (e.g., elongation $\kappa$ and triangularity $\delta$) is prescribed at the plasma boundary and "penetrates" toward the core.

* **Magnetic Shear Influence:** The penetration of shaping depends primarily on the magnetic shear $s$. Higher shear reduces shaping penetration into the core.
* **Core Values:** For a flat q-profile, elongation $\kappa$ remains constant while triangularity $\delta$ drops off linearly toward the magnetic axis.

## 6. Particle Trapping and Toroidicity
Toroidal effects create a "magnetic well" that traps certain particles, preventing them from circulating poloidally.

* **Trapping Condition:** Particles are trapped if their parallel velocity $v_{||}$ reaches zero, which happens when the field strength $B$ reaches $E/\mu$.
* **Conventional Orbits:** In standard tokamaks, particles exhibit "banana orbits".
* **Spherical Tokamaks:** High pressure and strong poloidal fields in spherical tokamaks can create unconventional local magnetic wells, leading to **Tear-Drop orbits**.
