    "text": "The safety factor \\(q\\) expresses the number of toroidal turns a magnetic field line makes for each poloidal turn in a toroidal confinement device, such as a tokamak.\nIt corresponds to the flux-surface averaged local pitch:\n\\[\nq(\\psi) \\equiv \\langle q_l \\rangle_{\\theta} = \\left\\langle \\frac{r B_{\\varphi}}{R B_{\\theta}}  \\right\\rangle_{\\theta}\n\\]\nwhere \\(r\\) is the minor radius coordinate, \\(B_{\\varphi}\\) is the toroidal magnetic field component, \\(R\\) is the major radius, and \\(B_{\\theta}\\) is the poloidal magnetic field component. A higher safety factor generally indicates greater stability against certain plasma instabilities.\nWith some assumptions it is possible to estimate the safety factor behavior in a tokamak: \\[\nB_{\\varphi} \\approx \\frac{\\mu_0}{2\\pi R} I_{coils};\n\\] \\[\nB_{\\theta} \\approx \\frac{\\mu_0}{2\\pi r} I_p = \\frac{\\mu_0}{2} J_p r;\n\\]\n\\[\n\\rightarrow q(\\psi) = \\left\\langle\\frac{I_{coils}}{\\pi R^2J_p }\\right\\rangle_{\\theta} = \\left\\langle\\frac{I_{coils}}{I_p}\\frac{r^2}{R^2}\\right\\rangle_{\\theta} .\n\\]\nThe interactive plot below allows you to explore how the safety factor \\(q\\) depends on key tokamak parameters. You can adjust:\n\n\\(\\epsilon\\): The inverse aspect ratio (\\(a/R_0\\)), where \\(a\\) is the minor radius and \\(R_0\\) is the major radius.\n\\(I_p\\): The plasma current (in Mega Amperes).\n\\(I_{coils}\\): The toroidal field coil current (in Mega Amperes).\n\nUse the sliders to see how changes in these parameters affect the safety factor profile.\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;function __main__.safety_factor_plot(eps=0.2841, Ip=1, I_coils=1)&gt;",
