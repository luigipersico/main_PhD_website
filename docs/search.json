Decomposition of the Integral\nThe double integral over the circular aperture \\(x'^2 + y'^2 \\le a^2\\) can be separated.

    "section": "Physical principles",
    "text": "Physical principles\nThe MSE diagnostic is based on the external injection of neutral beam deuterium atoms and, when entering the plasma, they are subject to inelastic collisions with plasma’s ions and electrons. The neutrals’ electrons, which initially are in their ground state, can reach a higher energy level, \\(E_{2}\\) and, when they decay to a lower energy state \\(E_{1}\\), they emit a photon with energy \\(E_{\\gamma} = E_2 - E_1\\), and wavelength \\(\\lambda = \\frac{hc}{E_{\\gamma}}\\).\nIn particular, of specific interest is the Balmer-\\(\\alpha\\) emission of the deuterium atom \\(D_{\\alpha}\\), which corresponds to the transition between \\(n=3\\) and \\(n=2\\), and is characterized by an energy \\(E_{D_{\\alpha}} = 1.89\\) eV and a wavelength \\(\\lambda_{D_{\\alpha}} = 656.279\\) nm. This is because the \\(D_{\\alpha}\\) emission has a high emission intensity in the visible spectrum (red light), and it is highly Doppler-shifted with respect to the plasma \\(D_{\\alpha}\\) emission. Moreover, since the neutral’s velocity across the magnetic field is high compared to the thermal velocity of the plasma ions, the resulting Lorentz electric field \\(\\mathbf{E_L} = \\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B}\\) is significant. This leads to a measurable splitting and polarization of the \\(D_{\\alpha}\\), spectral line, which can be used to infer the local magnetic field direction and magnitude inside the plasma.\nTo analyze the Stark effect in the deuterium atom, it is convenient to solve the non-relativistic Schrödinger Equation using parabolic coordinates. In this framework, the atomic states are described by four quantum numbers \\(|n, n_1, n_2, m\\rangle\\): \\(n\\) is the principal quantum number, \\(n_1\\) and \\(n_2\\) are parabolic quantum numbers, and \\(m\\) is the magnetic quantum number. The energy splitting caused by the Stark effect, calculated using first-order perturbation theory, is given by2:\n\\[\n\\Delta E^{(1)} = \\frac{3}{2} ea_0 n(n_1-n_2)|\\mathbf{E_L}|,\n\\]\nwhere \\(e\\) is the elementary charge, and \\(a_0\\) is the Bohr radius.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: \\(D_{\\alpha}\\) splitting due to MSE3.\n\n\n\nIn Figure 1 the lines splitting of the energy levels with principal quantum numbers \\(n=2\\) and \\(n=3\\) is shown. For clarity the fine structure splitting is not shown.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Spectral lines separation of the \\(D_{\\alpha}\\) radiation due to MSE3.\n\n\n\nThe separation of the spectral lines, as shown in Figure 2, is directly proportional to the strength of the electric field3:\n\\[\n\\Delta \\lambda \\approx \\frac{3ea_0|\\mathbf{E_L}|\\lambda_0^2}{2hc},\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\lambda_0\\) is the unshifted Balmer-\\(\\alpha\\) wavelength, \\(h\\) is Planck’s constant, and \\(c\\) is the speed of light.\nThe π and \\(\\mathrm{\\sigma}\\) components are resepectively polarized parallel and perpendicular to the electric field. This means that when trying to catch the radiation, the instensity of the components depend on the direction of the line-of-sight (LOS) respect to \\(\\mathbf{E_L}\\). Defining with \\(\\Psi\\) the angle between the LOS and \\(\\mathbf{E_L}\\), the observed intensities scale as:\n\\[\nI_{\\sigma} \\propto 1 + \\cos^2\\Psi,\n\\]\n\\[\nI_{\\pi} \\propto \\sin^2\\Psi.\n\\]",

Expansion of Terms We start with the equilibrium equation for the \\(m=0\\) mode (Eq. 3): \\[\\frac{1}{2r^2} (r^2 \\psi'^2)' + R_0^2 P' + FF' = 0\\]\nUsing the definition \\(\\psi' \\approx r B_0 / q\\) (leading order approximation where \\(F \\approx R_0 B_0\\)), we expand the first term: \\[\\psi'^2 \\approx \\frac{r^2 B_0^2}{q^2}\\] \\[\\frac{1}{2r^2} (r^2 \\psi'^2)' = \\frac{B_0^2}{2r^2} \\frac{d}{dr} \\left( \\frac{r^4}{q^2} \\right)\\] Using the definition of magnetic shear \\(s = (r/q) q'\\), the derivative becomes: \\[\\frac{d}{dr} \\left( \\frac{r^4}{q^2} \\right) = \\frac{4r^3 q^2 - 2r^4 q q'}{q^4} = \\frac{r^3}{q^2} (4 - 2s)\\] Thus, the first term is: \\[\\text{Term 1} = \\frac{B_0^2 r}{q^2} (2 - s)\\]\nNext, we expand the \\(FF'\\) term using \\(F = R_0 B_0 (1 + \\textcolor{red}{\\varepsilon^2} F_2)\\): \\[FF' = \\frac{1}{2} (F^2)' \\approx \\frac{1}{2} (R_0^2 B_0^2 (1 + 2\\textcolor{red}{\\varepsilon^2} F_2))' = R_0^2 B_0^2 \\textcolor{red}{\\varepsilon^2} F_2'\\]\n2. Solving for \\(F_2\\) Substituting these back into Eq. (3): \\[\\frac{B_0^2 r}{q^2} (2 - s) + R_0^2 P' + R_0^2 B_0^2 \\textcolor{red}{\\varepsilon^2} F_2' = 0\\]\nIsolating \\(F_2'\\): \\[F_2' = - \\frac{P'}{\\textcolor{red}{\\varepsilon^2} B_0^2} - \\frac{r (2-s)}{R_0^2 \\textcolor{red}{\\varepsilon^2} q^2}\\]\nIntegrating from \\(0\\) to \\(r\\): \\[F_2(r) = - \\textcolor{red}{\\varepsilon^{-2}} \\frac{P(r)}{B_0^2} - \\textcolor{red}{\\varepsilon^{-2}} \\int_0^r \\frac{r' dr'}{R_0^2} \\left( \\frac{2-s(r')}{q(r')^2} \\right)\\] This matches Eq. (6).\n3. Physical Explanation The magnetic field strength is dominated by the toroidal field \\(B_\\phi \\propto F(r)\\). In a vacuum, \\(F\\) is constant. In a plasma, \\(F\\) is modified by \\(\\textcolor{red}{\\varepsilon^2} F_2\\). Both terms in \\(F_2\\) are typically negative: 1. Pressure term: \\(-P/B_0^2\\) is negative because plasma is diamagnetic (resisting the external field). 2. Shear term: The integral of \\((2-s)\\) is generally positive (for moderate shear), making the term negative.\nSince \\(F_{plasma} &lt; F_{vacuum}\\), the magnetic field strength is reduced in the center, creating a magnetic well. This configuration is favorable for stability.\n\n\n\nSolution (b): Shafranov Shift\n1. Integration We rewrite Eq. (4) by multiplying by an integrating factor \\(r(\\psi')^2\\): \\[\\frac{d}{dr} \\left( r(\\psi')^2 \\Delta' \\right) = \\frac{r(\\psi')^2}{R_0} - 2r^2 R_0 P'\\]\nIntegrating from \\(0\\) to \\(r\\): \\[r(\\psi')^2 \\Delta' = \\frac{1}{R_0} \\int_0^r \\hat{r} (\\psi')^2 d\\hat{r} - 2R_0 \\int_0^r \\hat{r}^2 P' d\\hat{r}\\]\n2. Substitution Using the approximation \\(\\psi' \\approx r B_0 / q\\): \\[\\Delta' = \\frac{1}{r (r^2 B_0^2 / q^2) R_0} \\int_0^r \\hat{r} \\frac{\\hat{r}^2 B_0^2}{q^2} d\\hat{r} - \\frac{2R_0}{r (r^2 B_0^2 / q^2)} \\int_0^r \\hat{r}^2 P' d\\hat{r}\\]\nSimplifying the terms: * Term 1: \\(\\frac{q^2}{r^3 R_0} \\int_0^r \\frac{\\hat{r}^3}{q^2} d\\hat{r} = \\frac{r}{R_0} \\left[ \\frac{q^2}{r^4} \\int \\frac{\\hat{r}^3}{q^2} d\\hat{r} \\right] = \\frac{r}{R_0} \\frac{l_i(r)}{2}\\) * Term 2: \\(- \\frac{2 R_0 q^2}{r^3 B_0^2} \\int_0^r \\hat{r}^2 P' d\\hat{r} = \\frac{r}{R_0} \\left[ - \\frac{2 R_0^2 q^2}{B_0^2 r^4} \\int \\hat{r}^2 P' d\\hat{r} \\right] = \\frac{r}{R_0} \\beta_p(r)\\)\nResulting in: \\[\\Delta' = \\frac{r}{R_0} \\left( \\beta_p(r) + \\frac{l_i(r)}{2} \\right)\\]\n3. Physical Explanation \\(\\Delta(r)\\) represents the Shafranov Shift, an outward displacement of magnetic flux surfaces. This shift compresses flux surfaces on the outboard (\\(\\nabla R\\)) side. The two forces driving this are: 1. \\(\\beta_p\\) (Kinetic Pressure): The “tire-tube” force where plasma pressure tries to expand the torus volume. 2. \\(l_i\\) (Internal Inductance): The “hoop force” where the current loop tries to expand radially due to self-repulsion.\n\n\n\nSolution (c): Shearless Plasma\n1. Differential Equation For shearless plasma (\\(q = \\text{const}\\)), \\(\\psi' \\propto r\\), so \\(\\psi''/\\psi' = 1/r\\). Substituting into Eq. (5): \\[S_m'' + \\frac{3}{r} S_m' + \\frac{1-m^2}{r^2} S_m = 0\\] Using the trial solution \\(S_m \\sim r^k\\), we solve the characteristic equation \\(k^2 + 2k + (1-m^2) = 0\\), yielding roots \\(k = -1 \\pm m\\). Discarding the divergent root (\\(r^{-(m+1)}\\)), we get: \\[S_m(r) = S_m(a) \\left( \\frac{r}{a} \\right)^{m-1}\\]\n2. Shaping Penetration * Elongation (\\(m=2\\)): \\(S_2 \\propto r\\). \\[\\kappa(r) = \\frac{r - Cr}{r + Cr} = \\text{constant}\\] Elongation is constant from edge to core. * Triangularity (\\(m=3\\)): \\(S_3 \\propto r^2\\). \\[\\delta(r) = \\frac{4 C r^2}{r} \\propto r\\] Triangularity vanishes linearly towards the core.\n3. Effect of Positive Shear With positive shear (\\(s &gt; 0\\)), the damping term in the differential equation decreases (\\(\\frac{3-2s}{r}\\)). This leads to a larger characteristic exponent \\(k\\). A larger \\(k\\) means faster radial decay as \\(r \\to 0\\). Thus, positive shear inhibits the penetration of shaping into the core; the core becomes circular faster than in the shearless case.",

    "text": "Solutions\n\nSolution (a): Vector Identities\n1. General Identity We start with the perturbed magnetic field equation: \\[\\delta \\boldsymbol{B} = \\nabla \\times (\\boldsymbol{\\xi}_{\\perp} \\times \\boldsymbol{B})\\] Using the vector identity for the curl of a cross product: \\[\\nabla \\times (\\boldsymbol{A} \\times \\boldsymbol{B}) = (\\boldsymbol{B} \\cdot \\nabla)\\boldsymbol{A} - (\\boldsymbol{A} \\cdot \\nabla)\\boldsymbol{B} + \\boldsymbol{A}(\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{B}) - \\boldsymbol{B}(\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{A})\\] Substitute \\(\\boldsymbol{A} = \\boldsymbol{\\xi}_{\\perp}\\) and note that \\(\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{B} = 0\\): \\[\\delta \\boldsymbol{B} = (\\boldsymbol{B} \\cdot \\nabla)\\boldsymbol{\\xi}_{\\perp} - (\\boldsymbol{\\xi}_{\\perp} \\cdot \\nabla)\\boldsymbol{B} - \\boldsymbol{B}(\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\xi}_{\\perp})\\]\nNow, we take the dot product with \\(\\nabla X\\) (where \\(X\\) is an arbitrary scalar): \\[\\delta \\boldsymbol{B} \\cdot \\nabla X = [(\\boldsymbol{B} \\cdot \\nabla)\\boldsymbol{\\xi}_{\\perp}] \\cdot \\nabla X - [(\\boldsymbol{\\xi}_{\\perp} \\cdot \\nabla)\\boldsymbol{B}] \\cdot \\nabla X - (\\boldsymbol{B} \\cdot \\nabla X)(\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\xi}_{\\perp})\\]\nWe compare this to the desired Right Hand Side (RHS) of Eq. (8): \\[\\text{RHS} = (\\boldsymbol{B} \\cdot \\nabla)(\\boldsymbol{\\xi}_{\\perp} \\cdot \\nabla X) - \\nabla \\cdot [\\boldsymbol{\\xi}_{\\perp} (\\boldsymbol{B} \\cdot \\nabla X)]\\] Expanding the first term of the RHS using the chain rule: \\[(\\boldsymbol{B} \\cdot \\nabla)(\\boldsymbol{\\xi}_{\\perp} \\cdot \\nabla X) = [(\\boldsymbol{B} \\cdot \\nabla)\\boldsymbol{\\xi}_{\\perp}] \\cdot \\nabla X + \\boldsymbol{\\xi}_{\\perp} \\cdot [(\\boldsymbol{B} \\cdot \\nabla)\\nabla X]\\] Expanding the second term of the RHS: \\[\\nabla \\cdot [\\boldsymbol{\\xi}_{\\perp} (\\boldsymbol{B} \\cdot \\nabla X)] = (\\boldsymbol{B} \\cdot \\nabla X)(\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\xi}_{\\perp}) + \\boldsymbol{\\xi}_{\\perp} \\cdot \\nabla (\\boldsymbol{B} \\cdot \\nabla X)\\]\nSubstituting these back into the RHS expression, the terms involving second derivatives of \\(X\\) cancel out (specifically \\(\\boldsymbol{\\xi}_{\\perp} \\cdot [(\\boldsymbol{B} \\cdot \\nabla)\\nabla X]\\) and \\(\\boldsymbol{\\xi}_{\\perp} \\cdot \\nabla (\\boldsymbol{B} \\cdot \\nabla X)\\) are symmetric and cancel). We recover exactly the expression for \\(\\delta \\boldsymbol{B} \\cdot \\nabla X\\) derived above. Thus, Eq. (8) is proven.\n2. Radial Contravariant Field We apply Eq. (8) with \\(X = r\\) (the radial coordinate): \\[\\delta B^r = \\delta \\boldsymbol{B} \\cdot \\nabla r = (\\boldsymbol{B} \\cdot \\nabla)(\\boldsymbol{\\xi}_{\\perp} \\cdot \\nabla r) - \\nabla \\cdot [\\boldsymbol{\\xi}_{\\perp} (\\boldsymbol{B} \\cdot \\nabla r)]\\] Since \\(\\boldsymbol{B}\\) lies on flux surfaces, it is perpendicular to the radial gradient: \\(\\boldsymbol{B} \\cdot \\nabla r = 0\\). The second term vanishes entirely. We define \\(\\xi^r = \\boldsymbol{\\xi}_{\\perp} \\cdot \\nabla r\\). \\[\\delta B^r = (\\boldsymbol{B} \\cdot \\nabla) \\xi^r\\]\n\n\nSolution (b): Magnetic Operator\nWe are given the field representation: \\[\\boldsymbol{B} = F(r)\\nabla \\phi + \\psi' \\nabla \\phi \\times \\nabla r\\] The gradient operator in general coordinates is \\(\\nabla = \\nabla \\phi \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\phi} + \\nabla \\theta \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta} + \\nabla r \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}\\). We compute the operator \\(\\boldsymbol{B} \\cdot \\nabla\\): \\[\\boldsymbol{B} \\cdot \\nabla = (\\boldsymbol{B} \\cdot \\nabla \\phi) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\phi} + (\\boldsymbol{B} \\cdot \\nabla \\theta) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta} + (\\boldsymbol{B} \\cdot \\nabla r) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}\\]\n\nRadial component: As established, \\(\\boldsymbol{B} \\cdot \\nabla r = 0\\).\nToroidal component: \\[\\boldsymbol{B} \\cdot \\nabla \\phi = F(r) |\\nabla \\phi|^2 + \\psi' (\\nabla \\phi \\times \\nabla r) \\cdot \\nabla \\phi\\] The cross product term is zero (vector orthogonal to itself). In axisymmetric coordinates, \\(|\\nabla \\phi|^2 = 1/R^2\\). \\[\\boldsymbol{B} \\cdot \\nabla \\phi = \\frac{F}{R^2}\\]\nPoloidal component: In straight field line coordinates, the field lines appear straight in the \\(\\theta\\)-\\(\\phi\\) plane. The pitch of the field lines is defined by the safety factor \\(q(r)\\): \\[\\frac{\\boldsymbol{B} \\cdot \\nabla \\phi}{\\boldsymbol{B} \\cdot \\nabla \\theta} = q(r)\\] Therefore: \\[\\boldsymbol{B} \\cdot \\nabla \\theta = \\frac{1}{q} (\\boldsymbol{B} \\cdot \\nabla \\phi) = \\frac{F}{R^2 q}\\]\n\nSubstituting these coefficients back into the operator: \\[\\boldsymbol{B} \\cdot \\nabla = \\frac{F}{R^2} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\phi} + \\frac{F}{R^2 q} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta} = \\frac{F}{R^2} \\left[ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\phi} + \\frac{1}{q} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta} \\right]\\]\n\n\nSolution (c): Perturbed Radial Field\nWe assume a Fourier perturbation of the form \\(\\xi^r \\sim \\xi_0^r e^{i(n\\phi - m\\theta)}\\). (Note: The sign convention in the result \\([nq - m]\\) implies dependence \\(\\sim e^{in\\phi - im\\theta}\\)).\nUsing the result from (a) \\(\\delta B^r = (\\boldsymbol{B} \\cdot \\nabla) \\xi^r\\) and the operator from (b): \\[\\delta B^r = \\frac{F}{R^2} \\left[ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\phi} + \\frac{1}{q} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta} \\right] \\xi_0^r e^{i(n\\phi - m\\theta)}\\] Applying the derivatives (\\(\\partial_\\phi \\to in\\), \\(\\partial_\\theta \\to -im\\)): \\[\\delta B^r = \\frac{F}{R^2} \\left[ i n - \\frac{i m}{q} \\right] \\xi^r = \\frac{i F}{R^2 q} [nq - m] \\xi^r\\]\nLeading Order Approximation: For large aspect ratio tokamaks: * \\(R \\approx R_0\\) * \\(F(r) \\approx R_0 B_0\\) (The toroidal field function is dominated by the vacuum field). Substituting these: \\[\\frac{F}{R^2} \\approx \\frac{R_0 B_0}{R_0^2} = \\frac{B_0}{R_0}\\] Thus: \\[\\delta B_0^r = \\frac{i B_0}{R_0 q} [nq - m] \\xi_0^r\\]\nJustification for \\(m\\): In the large aspect ratio (cylindrical) limit, the equilibrium is symmetric in \\(\\theta\\). The poloidal harmonics decouple, meaning equations can be solved for a single unique \\(m\\) mode independently.\nComment on Rational Surface: A rational surface is defined where \\(q(r) = m/n\\). At this location, the term \\([nq - m]\\) becomes zero. Consequently, \\(\\delta B^r = 0\\) on the rational surface. This implies that in ideal MHD, the radial magnetic field perturbation vanishes at the resonance, preserving the magnetic topology (no magnetic island formation/reconnection).\n\n\nSolution (d): Stability and Shear\nLowest Order Solution: As derived above: \\(\\delta B_0^r \\propto (nq - m) \\xi_0^r\\).\nField Line Bending: The “field line bending” term is the restoring force in the potential energy \\(\\delta W\\) arising from the tension of the magnetic field lines. It is proportional to the parallel gradient of the perturbation: \\((\\boldsymbol{B} \\cdot \\nabla)\\boldsymbol{\\xi} \\propto (nq - m)\\).\n\nRational Surfaces: On a rational surface (\\(q = m/n\\)), this term vanishes. The field lines do not “bend” in response to the perturbation because the perturbation helix matches the field line pitch. This removes the stabilizing tension force at that specific radius.\n\nSheared vs. Unsheared Plasmas: 1. Unsheared (\\(q = \\text{const}\\)): If the plasma is unsheared and \\(q = m/n\\) everywhere (or over a large region), the stabilizing term \\((nq-m)\\) vanishes globally. The plasma loses magnetic tension stabilization over the whole volume, making it highly unstable to helical distortions (kink modes). 2. Sheared (\\(q' \\neq 0\\)): If the plasma has shear, the resonance condition \\(q(r) = m/n\\) is only satisfied at a specific radius (the rational surface). Away from this surface, \\(|nq - m|\\) grows, and the field line bending term becomes non-zero.\nDoes Shear Improve Stability? Yes. Magnetic shear localizes the region where the stabilizing field line bending force vanishes. Even if low-order rational surfaces cannot be avoided, shear ensures that the instability is essentially “pinned” or stabilized by the magnetic tension in the regions immediately surrounding the rational surface. This makes it much harder for global modes to grow compared to the shearless case.",

    "text": "Solutions\n\nSolution (a): Vacuum Flux Solution\n1. Apply Boundary Condition at the Wall (\\(r=b\\)) The conducting wall at \\(r=b\\) requires the normal component of the perturbed magnetic field to vanish: \\(\\delta B^r(b) = 0\\). Given \\(\\delta B^r = im \\delta \\psi / r\\), this implies \\(\\delta \\psi(b) = 0\\). Substituting this into the general form (Eq. 12): \\[\\alpha b^m + \\beta b^{-m} = 0 \\implies \\beta = - \\alpha b^{2m}\\] Substituting \\(\\beta\\) back into Eq. (12): \\[\\delta \\psi(r) = \\alpha (r^m - b^{2m} r^{-m}) = \\alpha r^m \\left[ 1 - \\left( \\frac{b}{r} \\right)^{2m} \\right]\\]\n2. Apply Boundary Condition at the Plasma Surface (\\(r=a\\)) At the plasma interface, the radial magnetic field perturbation must be continuous. From the plasma side (internal solution), using the result from the previous exercise: \\[\\delta B^r(a) = \\frac{i B_0}{R_0 q_a} [n q_a - m] \\xi_a = \\frac{i B_0}{R_0} \\left( n - \\frac{m}{q_a} \\right) \\xi_a\\] From the vacuum side: \\[\\delta B^r(a) = \\frac{i m \\delta \\psi(a)}{a}\\] Equating the two expressions: \\[\\frac{i m \\delta \\psi(a)}{a} = \\frac{i B_0}{R_0} m \\left( \\frac{n}{m} - \\frac{1}{q_a} \\right) \\xi_a\\] Solving for \\(\\delta \\psi(a)\\): \\[\\delta \\psi(a) = \\frac{a B_0}{R_0} \\left( \\frac{n}{m} - \\frac{1}{q_a} \\right) \\xi_a\\]\n3. Construct the Final Solution We express the radial dependence using the form derived in step 1, normalized to the value at \\(a\\): \\[\\delta \\psi(r) = \\delta \\psi(a) \\frac{r^m - b^{2m}r^{-m}}{a^m - b^{2m}a^{-m}}\\] To match Eq. (13), we multiply the numerator and denominator by \\(b^{-m}\\): \\[\\frac{b^{-m}(r^m - b^{2m}r^{-m})}{b^{-m}(a^m - b^{2m}a^{-m})} = \\frac{(r/b)^m - (b/r)^m}{(a/b)^m - (b/a)^m}\\] Substituting \\(\\delta \\psi(a)\\): \\[\\delta \\psi(r) = \\frac{B_0}{R_0} \\left( \\frac{n}{m} - \\frac{1}{q_a} \\right) a \\xi_a \\left[ \\frac{(\\frac{r}{b})^m - (\\frac{b}{r})^m}{(\\frac{a}{b})^m - (\\frac{b}{a})^m} \\right]\\]\n\n\nSolution (b): Total Potential Energy\n1. Calculate Vacuum Energy \\(\\delta W_V\\) We evaluate the integral in Eq. (11): \\[\\delta W_V \\approx 2\\pi^2 R_0 \\left[ r \\delta \\psi \\frac{d\\delta \\psi}{dr} \\right]_a^b\\] Since \\(\\delta \\psi(b) = 0\\), the upper limit vanishes. \\[\\delta W_V = - 2\\pi^2 R_0 \\left( a \\delta \\psi(a) \\delta \\psi'(a) \\right)\\]\nFirst, find the logarithmic derivative \\(\\frac{\\delta \\psi'(a)}{\\delta \\psi(a)}\\). Let \\(f(r) = (r/b)^m - (b/r)^m\\). Then \\(\\delta \\psi(r) \\propto f(r)\\). \\[f'(r) = \\frac{m}{b} (r/b)^{m-1} + \\frac{m}{r} (b/r)^m = \\frac{m}{r} \\left[ (r/b)^m + (b/r)^m \\right]\\] \\[\\frac{\\delta \\psi'(a)}{\\delta \\psi(a)} = \\frac{f'(a)}{f(a)} = \\frac{m}{a} \\frac{(a/b)^m + (b/a)^m}{(a/b)^m - (b/a)^m}\\] Multiply numerator and denominator by \\((a/b)^m\\): \\[\\frac{(a/b)^{2m} + 1}{(a/b)^{2m} - 1} = - \\frac{1 + (a/b)^{2m}}{1 - (a/b)^{2m}} = - \\lambda\\] Thus, \\(\\delta \\psi'(a) = - \\frac{m}{a} \\lambda \\delta \\psi(a)\\).\nSubstitute back into the energy equation: \\[\\delta W_V = - 2\\pi^2 R_0 a \\delta \\psi(a) \\left( - \\frac{m}{a} \\lambda \\delta \\psi(a) \\right) = 2\\pi^2 R_0 m \\lambda (\\delta \\psi(a))^2\\]\nNow substitute the expression for \\(\\delta \\psi(a)\\) derived in Part (a): \\[\\delta W_V = 2\\pi^2 R_0 m \\lambda \\left[ \\frac{a^2 B_0^2}{R_0^2} \\left( \\frac{n}{m} - \\frac{1}{q_a} \\right)^2 \\xi_a^2 \\right]\\] \\[\\delta W_V = \\frac{2\\pi^2 B_0^2}{R_0} a^2 \\xi_a^2 \\left[ m \\lambda \\left( \\frac{n}{m} - \\frac{1}{q_a} \\right)^2 \\right]\\]\n2. Combine with Plasma Energy \\(\\delta W_P\\) Add the \\(\\delta W_V\\) term to the surface terms (coefficients of \\(a^2 \\xi_a^2\\)) in Eq. (10). Existing surface term: \\[\\left[ \\frac{2}{q_a} \\left( \\frac{n}{m} - \\frac{1}{q_a} \\right) + \\left( \\frac{n}{m} - \\frac{1}{q_a} \\right)^2 \\right]\\] Adding vacuum term \\(m \\lambda (\\dots)^2\\): \\[\\frac{2}{q_a} \\left( \\frac{n}{m} - \\frac{1}{q_a} \\right) + (1 + m \\lambda) \\left( \\frac{n}{m} - \\frac{1}{q_a} \\right)^2\\] This matches Eq. (14) exactly.\n\n\n\nAnalysis and Interpretation\n1. Destabilizing Term The only term in Eq. (14) that can be negative (destabilizing) is the linear term in the boundary bracket: \\[\\frac{2}{q_a} \\left( \\frac{n}{m} - \\frac{1}{q_a} \\right)\\] The integral term is always positive (stabilizing), and the quadratic term \\((1+m\\lambda)(\\dots)^2\\) is always positive.\n2. Condition for Destabilization For the term to be negative, we require: \\[\\frac{n}{m} - \\frac{1}{q_a} &lt; 0 \\implies \\frac{n}{m} &lt; \\frac{1}{q_a} \\implies n q_a &lt; m\\] Instability generally requires the edge safety factor \\(q_a\\) to be less than the rational surface value \\(m/n\\).\n3. Effect of Wall Position (\\(b/a\\)) * \\(b/a \\to \\infty\\) (Wall at infinity): \\[\\lambda \\to \\frac{1+0}{1-0} = 1\\] The vacuum energy is minimized, providing the least amount of stabilization. * \\(b/a \\to 1\\) (Wall touching plasma): \\[\\lambda \\to \\frac{2}{0} \\to \\infty\\] The stabilizing term \\((1+m\\lambda)(\\dots)^2\\) becomes infinite. This forces \\(\\delta W\\) to be positive (stable) unless \\(\\xi_a = 0\\). This is the phenomenon of wall stabilization.\n4. Establishing Instability To prove instability, one must find a trial displacement function \\(\\xi(r)\\) that makes the total potential energy \\(\\delta W &lt; 0\\). If \\(\\delta W\\) can be made negative, the system is unstable.\n5. Stabilizing Effects * Main Effect: The presence of the conducting wall (represented by \\(\\lambda\\)) is a major stabilizing factor for the external kink mode. * Stabilization Strategy: If \\(q_a\\) cannot be adjusted (e.g., to satisfy \\(q_a &gt; m/n\\)), the plasma can be made more stable by bringing the conducting wall closer to the plasma surface (decreasing \\(b/a\\)). This increases \\(\\lambda\\) and consequently increases the vacuum magnetic energy penalty for kinking.",

    "text": "Solutions\n\nSolution (a): Resistive Layer Width\n1. Substitute the Growth Rate Expression We start with the expression for the resistive layer width: \\[\n\\frac{\\delta}{r_s} = \\left[ \\frac{1}{n^2 s^2 S} \\cdot \\frac{\\gamma}{\\omega_A} \\right]^{1/4}\n\\] Now substitute the given expression for \\(\\gamma / \\omega_A\\): \\[\n\\frac{\\gamma}{\\omega_A} = \\left[ \\frac{\\Gamma(1/4) r_s \\Delta'}{2\\pi \\Gamma(3/4)} \\right]^{4/5} S^{-3/5} (ns)^{2/5}\n\\] Numerical factor calculation: Using \\(\\Gamma(1/4) \\approx 3.6256\\) and \\(\\Gamma(3/4) \\approx 1.2254\\): \\[\nC = \\frac{\\Gamma(1/4)}{2\\pi \\Gamma(3/4)} \\approx \\frac{3.6256}{2\\pi (1.2254)} \\approx \\frac{3.6256}{7.699} \\approx 0.47\n\\] Wait, let’s look at the target result. The target has a factor \\(1/2.12\\) inside the bracket. Note that \\(1/0.47 \\approx 2.12\\). So the term inside the bracket is indeed \\((r_s \\Delta' / 2.12)\\).\nLet’s proceed with the algebraic substitution: \\[\n\\frac{\\delta}{r_s} = \\left[ \\frac{1}{n^2 s^2 S} \\cdot \\left( \\frac{r_s \\Delta'}{2.12} \\right)^{4/5} S^{-3/5} (ns)^{2/5} \\right]^{1/4}\n\\]\n2. Group the Powers * Powers of S: \\[S^{-1} \\cdot S^{-3/5} = S^{-8/5}\\] Taking the 1/4 root: \\((S^{-8/5})^{1/4} = S^{-2/5}\\). * Powers of ns: We have \\(n^2 s^2 = (ns)^2\\) in the denominator, so \\((ns)^{-2}\\). Combined with numerator: \\((ns)^{-2} \\cdot (ns)^{2/5} = (ns)^{-10/5 + 2/5} = (ns)^{-8/5}\\). Taking the 1/4 root: \\(((ns)^{-8/5})^{1/4} = (ns)^{-2/5}\\). * Powers of \\((r_s \\Delta' / 2.12)\\): Inside we have the term raised to the power \\(4/5\\). Taking the 1/4 root: \\((( \\dots )^{4/5})^{1/4} = (\\dots)^{1/5}\\).\n3. Final Result Combining these components: \\[\n\\frac{\\delta}{r_s} = S^{-2/5} (ns)^{-2/5} \\left( \\frac{r_s \\Delta'}{2.12} \\right)^{1/5}\n\\]\n4. Validity Check for Typical Parameters Given: \\(r_s \\Delta' \\sim 1\\), \\(S \\sim 10^8\\), \\(ns \\sim 1\\). Calculate \\(\\delta/r_s\\): \\[\n\\frac{\\delta}{r_s} \\sim (10^8)^{-0.4} (1)^{-0.4} (1/2.12)^{0.2}\n\\] \\[(10^8)^{-0.4} = 10^{-3.2} \\approx 6 \\times 10^{-4}\\] The term \\((1/2.12)^{0.2}\\) is of order unity (\\(\\approx 0.86\\)). So, \\(\\delta / r_s \\sim 5 \\times 10^{-4}\\).\nNow check the condition \\(\\delta \\Delta' \\ll 1\\). Multiply by \\(r_s\\) on both sides to make it dimensionless using \\(r_s \\Delta'\\): \\[(\\delta/r_s) \\cdot (r_s \\Delta') \\ll 1\\] \\[5 \\times 10^{-4} \\cdot 1 = 0.0005 \\ll 1\\] Conclusion: Yes, the inequality is valid for these typical parameters. The resistive layer is extremely thin compared to the plasma radius.\n\n\n\nSolution (b): Constant-Psi Condition\n1. Requirement of Inequality (15) The inequality \\(\\delta \\Delta' \\ll 1\\) (or equivalently \\(\\Delta' \\delta \\ll 1\\)) is the Constant-Psi Approximation. * Physical Meaning: It implies that the perturbed magnetic flux \\(\\delta \\psi\\) is approximately constant across the narrow resistive layer width (\\(-\\delta &lt; x &lt; \\delta\\), where \\(x = r - r_s\\)). * Length Scales: * From ideal MHD (Eq. 17), outside the layer where \\(\\eta \\to 0\\), the radial displacement \\(\\xi_r\\) is singular at the resonance. * Inside the layer, \\(\\xi_r\\) varies rapidly (from a large value to zero or flipping sign). * \\(\\delta \\psi\\) varies slowly. The condition \\(\\delta \\Delta' \\ll 1\\) implies that the change in \\(\\psi\\) across the layer (\\(\\Delta \\psi \\sim \\delta \\cdot \\psi'\\)) is much smaller than \\(\\psi\\) itself. * Therefore, the length scale of the flux variation is much larger than the resistive layer width \\(\\delta\\).\n2. Definition of \\(\\Delta'\\) \\(\\Delta'\\) is the stability index or discontinuity parameter. It is defined as the jump in the logarithmic derivative of the perturbed flux across the singular surface \\(r_s\\):\n\\[\n\\Delta' = \\lim_{\\epsilon \\to 0} \\left[ \\frac{1}{\\delta \\psi(r_s)} \\left( \\frac{d(\\delta \\psi)}{dr} \\Big|_{r_s + \\epsilon} - \\frac{d(\\delta \\psi)}{dr} \\Big|_{r_s - \\epsilon} \\right) \\right]\n\\] This assumes \\(\\delta \\psi(r_s)\\) is constant (continuous and non-zero) across the layer.\n\n\n\nSolution (c): Calculating \\(\\Delta'\\) and Stability\n1. Simplifying the Equation We want to calculate \\(\\Delta'\\) to find the growth rate. We do this by solving for \\(\\delta \\psi\\) in the “outer” (ideal) regions where we can neglect inertia (\\(\\gamma \\to 0\\)) and resistivity (\\(\\eta \\to 0\\)).\nIn the ideal region (away from \\(r_s\\)): * \\(\\gamma \\approx 0\\) means the Left Hand Side (Inertia) of Eq. (16) \\(\\to 0\\). * \\(\\eta \\approx 0\\) in Eq. (17) simplifies the relation between \\(\\xi\\) and \\(\\psi\\).\nSetting LHS of (16) to zero: \\[\n0 = - m^2 \\frac{R_0}{B_0} \\left\\{ \\left( \\frac{n}{m} - \\frac{1}{q} \\right) \\left( \\nabla_\\perp^2 \\delta \\psi \\right) + r \\delta \\psi \\frac{R_0}{B_0} \\frac{dJ_{\\phi}}{dr} \\right\\}\n\\] Note: The term \\(r \\frac{d}{dr} [ r \\frac{d}{dr} \\delta \\psi ] - m^2 \\delta \\psi\\) is the radial part of the Laplacian \\(\\nabla^2 \\delta \\psi\\) (multiplied by \\(r\\)).\nRearranging, we obtain the Newcomb Equation (or the exterior tearing mode equation): \\[\n\\frac{d}{dr} \\left( r \\frac{d \\delta \\psi}{dr} \\right) - m^2 \\delta \\psi - \\frac{q R_0 \\frac{dJ_{\\phi}}{dr}}{B_0 (1 - nq/m)} \\delta \\psi = 0\n\\] (Note: Using the approximation \\((n/m - 1/q) \\approx (nq - m)/mq\\), the current gradient term simplifies to the form containing the standard tearing drive).\n2. Boundary Conditions and Matching * Boundary Conditions: * \\(r=0\\): \\(\\delta \\psi \\propto r^m\\) (regularity at core). * \\(r=a\\): \\(\\delta \\psi(a)\\) matches the vacuum solution (or \\(\\psi(a)=0\\) if a wall is on the plasma surface). * Matching: We integrate this differential equation numerically or analytically from the center (\\(r=0\\)) out to the singular surface (\\(r_s^-\\)), and from the edge (\\(r=a\\)) in to the singular surface (\\(r_s^+\\)). Since the equation is singular at \\(r_s\\) (where \\(nq=m\\)), the slope \\(d\\psi/dr\\) diverges, but we can calculate the slopes as we approach the limit. We compute the jump in the slope: \\[\n    \\Delta' = \\frac{\\psi'(r_s^+) - \\psi'(r_s^-)}{\\psi(r_s)}\n    \\]\n3. Stability Determinant * What determines stability? The growth rate \\(\\gamma\\) scales with \\(\\Delta'\\) (specifically \\(\\gamma \\propto (\\Delta')^{4/5}\\)). * If \\(\\Delta' &gt; 0\\): The mode is Unstable (\\(\\gamma &gt; 0\\)). * If \\(\\Delta' &lt; 0\\): The mode is Stable. * Role of Resistivity vs. Profile: * Resistivity: It is a necessary condition for the mode to exist (it allows the reconnection at \\(r_s\\)). However, the sign of the stability (stable vs unstable) is NOT determined by the resistivity value. It is determined purely by \\(\\Delta'\\). * q-profile / Current Profile: \\(\\Delta'\\) is determined entirely by the geometry of the equilibrium fields, specifically the Current Gradient term (\\(dJ_{\\phi}/dr\\)) and the \\(q\\)-profile in the ideal equation derived above. Therefore, the stability is determined by the macroscopic toroidal current profile. * Analogy: Resistivity opens the door (allows breaking field lines), but the current profile pushes the door open (provides the free energy \\(\\Delta'\\)).",

    "text": "Solutions\n\nSolution (a): Coordinate Systems\n1. Applicability to any system: Eq. (18) is derived using the general properties of the eikonal representation in axisymmetric toroidal geometry. The coordinate \\(\\Theta\\) represents any poloidal angle coordinate. The structure of the equation depends only on field line tracing (\\(\\beta = \\text{const}\\) along field lines) and the Jacobian \\(\\mathcal{J}\\). Therefore, it is valid for straight-field-line coordinates \\((\\psi, \\theta, \\phi)\\), geometric coordinates \\((\\psi, \\omega, \\phi)\\), or any other valid flux coordinate system, provided the Jacobian and metric elements are transformed consistently.\n2. Choice of \\((\\psi, \\omega, \\phi)\\): We select the inverse aspect ratio expanded system (using the geometric angle \\(\\omega\\)) because: * Analytic Tractability: In the large aspect ratio limit (\\(\\epsilon \\ll 1\\)), the metric elements and Jacobian in geometric coordinates have simple analytic forms (e.g., \\(R \\approx R_0(1 + \\epsilon \\cos \\omega)\\)). * Separation of Effects: This coordinate system allows us to explicitly separate the “straight field line” effects (encoded in the relation \\(\\theta = \\omega - \\dots\\)) from the geometric effects (curvature, shaping). * Ordering: It facilitates the systematic expansion in powers of \\(\\epsilon\\) (such as retaining \\(O(\\epsilon)\\) terms like the Shafranov shift \\(\\Delta'\\)) which are crucial for deriving the \\(s-\\alpha\\) model.\n\n\nSolution (b): Weird Curvature Term\n1. Setup and Ordering We calculate the term inside the curly brackets: \\(T = (\\nabla \\beta)^2 \\nabla \\psi \\cdot \\nabla \\omega - (\\nabla \\beta \\cdot \\nabla \\psi)(\\nabla \\beta \\cdot \\nabla \\omega)\\). Approximation: Neglect non-orthogonal terms \\(\\nabla \\psi \\cdot \\nabla \\omega \\approx 0\\). Thus, the first term vanishes, leaving: \\[T \\approx - (\\nabla \\beta \\cdot \\nabla \\psi)(\\nabla \\beta \\cdot \\nabla \\omega)\\]\n2. Gradients of \\(\\beta\\) Recall \\(\\beta = \\phi - q(\\psi)\\theta\\). Using \\(\\theta = \\omega - \\lambda(\\omega)\\) where \\(\\lambda = (\\epsilon + \\Delta')\\sin\\omega\\). \\[\n\\nabla \\beta = \\nabla \\phi - q' \\theta \\nabla \\psi - q \\nabla \\theta\n\\] \\[\n\\nabla \\theta = \\nabla \\omega - \\frac{\\partial \\lambda}{\\partial \\psi} \\nabla \\psi - \\frac{\\partial \\lambda}{\\partial \\omega} \\nabla \\omega = (1 - \\lambda_\\omega) \\nabla \\omega - \\lambda_\\psi \\nabla \\psi\n\\] Substituting \\(\\nabla \\theta\\) into \\(\\nabla \\beta\\): \\[\n\\nabla \\beta = \\nabla \\phi - q' \\theta \\nabla \\psi - q [(1 - \\lambda_\\omega)\\nabla \\omega - \\lambda_\\psi \\nabla \\psi]\n\\] \\[\n\\nabla \\beta = \\nabla \\phi - (q' \\theta - q \\lambda_\\psi) \\nabla \\psi - q(1 - \\lambda_\\omega) \\nabla \\omega\n\\]\n3. Calculating Dot Products * \\(\\nabla \\beta \\cdot \\nabla \\psi\\): Using orthogonality \\(\\nabla \\phi \\cdot \\nabla \\psi = 0\\) and \\(\\nabla \\omega \\cdot \\nabla \\psi \\approx 0\\): \\[\n    \\nabla \\beta \\cdot \\nabla \\psi \\approx - (q' \\theta - q \\lambda_\\psi) |\\nabla \\psi|^2\n    \\] Recall \\(\\psi' \\approx r B_0 / q\\). So \\(|\\nabla \\psi|^2 \\approx (\\psi')^2 \\approx (r B_0 / q)^2\\). Also, \\(q' = s q / r\\). Term A: \\(q' \\theta = (sq/r) \\omega\\) (to leading order \\(\\theta \\approx \\omega\\)). Term B: \\(\\lambda_\\psi = \\partial_r [(\\epsilon + \\Delta')\\sin \\omega] / \\psi'\\). Since \\(\\epsilon = r/R_0\\), \\(\\partial_r \\epsilon = 1/R_0\\). And \\(\\partial_r \\Delta' = \\Delta''\\). So \\(\\partial_r \\lambda = (1/R_0 + \\Delta'')\\sin \\omega\\). Thus \\(\\lambda_\\psi = \\frac{1}{\\psi'} (\\epsilon/r + \\Delta'') \\sin \\omega\\).\nCombining:\n$$\nq' \\theta - q \\lambda_\\psi \\approx \\frac{sq \\omega}{r} - \\frac{q}{\\psi'} \\left( \\frac{\\epsilon}{r} + \\Delta'' \\right) \\sin \\omega\n$$\nMultiply by $|\\nabla \\psi|^2$:\n$$\n\\nabla \\beta \\cdot \\nabla \\psi \\approx - |\\nabla \\psi|^2 \\left[ \\frac{sq \\omega}{r} - \\frac{q}{\\psi'} \\Delta'' \\sin \\omega \\right]\n$$\n\n\\(\\nabla \\beta \\cdot \\nabla \\omega\\): \\[\n  \\nabla \\beta \\cdot \\nabla \\omega \\approx - q(1 - \\lambda_\\omega) |\\nabla \\omega|^2 \\approx - \\frac{q}{r^2}\n  \\] (Using \\(|\\nabla \\omega|^2 = 1/r^2\\) and \\(1-\\lambda_\\omega \\approx 1\\)).\n\n4. Combining into \\(T\\) \\[\nT \\approx - (\\nabla \\beta \\cdot \\nabla \\psi)(\\nabla \\beta \\cdot \\nabla \\omega)\n\\] \\[\nT \\approx - \\left( - |\\nabla \\psi|^2 [ \\dots ] \\right) \\left( - \\frac{q}{r^2} \\right) = - \\frac{q |\\nabla \\psi|^2}{r^2} \\left[ \\frac{sq \\omega}{r} - \\frac{q}{\\psi'} (\\frac{\\epsilon}{r} + \\Delta'') \\sin \\omega \\right]\n\\] Using \\(|\\nabla \\psi| = \\psi'\\): \\[\nT = \\frac{q^2(\\psi')}{r^3} [(\\epsilon + r\\Delta'') \\sin \\omega - s\\omega]\n\\] This matches the target expression.\n\n\nSolution (c): Total Weird Curvature\n1. Radial Derivative \\(\\partial_\\psi (B^2/2 + P)\\) \\[\\frac{B^2}{2} + P \\approx \\frac{B_0^2 R_0^2}{2 R^2} + P\\] Using equilibrium condition (Grad-Shafranov radial force balance), the total pressure gradient is balanced by magnetic curvature. To leading order in a tokamak: \\[\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\psi} \\left( \\frac{B^2}{2} + P \\right) \\approx - \\frac{B^2}{R_c} \\frac{1}{|\\nabla \\psi|} \\approx - \\frac{B^2}{R} \\frac{1}{\\psi'} \\approx - \\frac{B_0}{R_0 \\psi'} B_0\\] Actually, let’s use the explicit expansion provided. \\(B^2 \\approx \\frac{R_0^2}{R^2} B_0^2 \\approx B_0^2 (1 - 2\\epsilon \\cos \\omega)\\). \\(\\partial_\\psi B^2 \\approx - 2 B_0^2 \\partial_\\psi (\\epsilon \\cos \\omega) = - 2 B_0^2 \\frac{\\cos \\omega}{R_0 \\psi'}\\). This is the Normal Curvature term. \\[\\kappa_n \\sim - \\frac{1}{\\psi' R_0} \\cos \\omega\\]\n2. Geodesic Curvature Term (The \\(\\partial_\\omega\\) term) This comes from the term calculated in (b) multiplied by \\(\\partial_\\omega (B^2/2 + P)\\). \\(\\partial_\\omega P = 0\\). \\(\\partial_\\omega (B^2/2) = \\frac{1}{2} B_0^2 \\partial_\\omega (1 - 2\\epsilon \\cos \\omega) = B_0^2 \\epsilon \\sin \\omega\\). The operator is: \\[\\text{Coeff} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\omega} \\left( \\frac{B^2}{2} \\right) = \\left[ \\frac{q^2 \\psi'}{r^3 B^2} (\\dots) \\right] (B_0^2 \\epsilon \\sin \\omega)\\] \\[\\approx \\frac{q^2 \\psi'}{r^3 B_0^2} [(\\epsilon + r\\Delta'')\\sin \\omega - s\\omega] (B_0^2 \\frac{r}{R_0} \\sin \\omega)\\] \\[= \\frac{q^2 \\psi'}{r^2 R_0} [(\\epsilon + r\\Delta'')\\sin \\omega - s\\omega] \\sin \\omega\\] Using \\(\\psi' \\approx r B_0 / q\\): \\[\\approx \\frac{q B_0}{r R_0} [\\dots] \\sin \\omega = \\frac{1}{\\psi' R_0} \\frac{q^2 \\psi'^2}{r B_0} [\\dots]\\] Combining the Normal part (1) and Geodesic part (2): \\[\\kappa_w = - \\frac{1}{\\psi' R_0} \\left[ \\cos \\omega + \\sin \\omega (s\\omega - r\\Delta'' \\sin \\omega) \\right]\\] (The \\(\\epsilon(1 - 1/q^2)\\) term is a small correction to the normal curvature).\n\n\nSolution (d): Ballooning and Interchange\n1. Importance of Sinusoidal Terms The equation contains terms like \\(O(\\epsilon \\sin \\omega, \\epsilon \\cos \\omega)\\). * Ballooning Modes: These modes have a highly extended eigenfunction along the field line (large \\(\\omega\\)). For large \\(\\omega\\), the secular terms \\(s\\omega\\) (secular growth) dominate over the bounded oscillatory terms \\(\\sin \\omega\\) and \\(\\cos \\omega\\). Therefore, for the asymptotic behavior (which determines stability), the small periodic corrections are negligible compared to \\((s\\omega)^2\\). * Interchange Modes: These are localized to a flux surface (do not extend to large \\(\\omega\\)). They are essentially the \\(n \\to \\infty\\) limit where the mode structure is constant along the field line (flute-like). For these modes, we average over \\(\\omega\\). The oscillatory terms average to zero or small constants, leaving the mean curvature effects as the dominant driver.\n2. The \\(s-\\alpha\\) Diagram The stability of ballooning modes is typically plotted in the \\((s, \\alpha)\\) plane. * s (Magnetic Shear): Stabilizing (usually). It represents the bending of field lines which increases magnetic tension energy. * \\(\\alpha\\) (Pressure Gradient): Destabilizing. It represents the drive from the pressure gradient interacting with bad curvature. * Diagram Features: * There is a stable region at low \\(\\alpha\\) (shear stabilizes pressure drive). * There is an unstable region at intermediate \\(\\alpha\\). * Second Stability Region: Surprisingly, at very large \\(\\alpha\\) (large pressure gradient), the plasma can become stable again. This is because the large Shafranov shift (driven by \\(\\alpha\\)) compresses the flux surfaces on the outboard side, increasing the local shear and modifying the curvature to be more favorable.\n3. Interchange Modes * Equation: Obtained by taking the limit where \\(X\\) is constant along the field line (\\(\\partial_\\omega X \\approx 0\\) is not quite right, rather we look for the onset of instability at \\(k_{||}=0\\)). More formally, we derive the Mercier Criterion. The simplified differential equation (near marginal stability) looks like: \\[\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\omega} \\left[ (1 + (s\\omega)^2) \\frac{\\partial X}{\\partial \\omega} \\right] + \\alpha [\\cos \\omega + s\\omega \\sin \\omega] X = 0\\] (Actually, the interchange limit averages this). * Marginal Stability Criterion (Mercier): \\[- D_I &lt; \\frac{1}{4}\\] Where \\(D_I \\approx E + F + H - 1/4\\). A simplified version for circular cross section is \\(q^2 &gt; 1\\) (for \\(m=1\\)). Or generally, stability requires \\(D_I &lt; 1/4\\). The standard Suydam Criterion (for cylinder) is: \\[\\frac{r B_z^2}{8 \\mu_0} \\left( \\frac{q'}{q} \\right)^2 + P' &gt; 0\\] (Shear is stabilizing, Pressure gradient is destabilizing). * Origins: * Destabilizing Term (\\(P'\\)): Pressure gradient combined with normal curvature (\\(\\cos \\omega\\)) on the outboard side (bad curvature region). * Stabilizing Term (\\(s^2\\)): Magnetic Shear. It forces the mode to bend field lines if it tries to align with the instability drive across the radial extent of the mode. * Magnetic Well: (Implicit in tokamak geometry). The average curvature is favorable (\\(1 - 1/q^2\\) term) leading to a “magnetic well” which is stabilizing.",

    "text": "Solutions\n\nSolution (a): Coordinate Systems\n1. Applicability to any system: Eq. (18) is derived using the general properties of the eikonal representation in axisymmetric toroidal geometry. The coordinate \\(\\Theta\\) represents any poloidal angle coordinate. The structure of the equation depends only on field line tracing (\\(\\beta = \\text{const}\\) along field lines) and the Jacobian \\(\\mathcal{J}\\). Therefore, it is valid for straight-field-line coordinates \\((\\psi, \\theta, \\phi)\\), geometric coordinates \\((\\psi, \\omega, \\phi)\\), or any other valid flux coordinate system, provided the Jacobian and metric elements are transformed consistently.\n2. Choice of \\((\\psi, \\omega, \\phi)\\): We select the inverse aspect ratio expanded system (using the geometric angle \\(\\omega\\)) because: * Analytic Tractability: In the large aspect ratio limit (\\(\\epsilon \\ll 1\\)), the metric elements and Jacobian in geometric coordinates have simple analytic forms (e.g., \\(R \\approx R_0(1 + \\epsilon \\cos \\omega)\\)). * Separation of Effects: This coordinate system allows us to explicitly separate the “straight field line” effects (encoded in the relation \\(\\theta = \\omega - \\dots\\)) from the geometric effects (curvature, shaping). * Ordering: It facilitates the systematic expansion in powers of \\(\\epsilon\\) (such as retaining \\(O(\\epsilon)\\) terms like the Shafranov shift \\(\\Delta'\\)) which are crucial for deriving the \\(s-\\alpha\\) model.\n\n\nSolution (b): Weird Curvature Term\n1. Setup and Ordering We calculate the term inside the curly brackets: \\(T = (\\nabla \\beta)^2 \\nabla \\psi \\cdot \\nabla \\omega - (\\nabla \\beta \\cdot \\nabla \\psi)(\\nabla \\beta \\cdot \\nabla \\omega)\\). Approximation: Neglect non-orthogonal terms \\(\\nabla \\psi \\cdot \\nabla \\omega \\approx 0\\). Thus, the first term vanishes, leaving: \\[T \\approx - (\\nabla \\beta \\cdot \\nabla \\psi)(\\nabla \\beta \\cdot \\nabla \\omega)\\]\n2. Gradients of \\(\\beta\\) Recall \\(\\beta = \\phi - q(\\psi)\\theta\\). Using \\(\\theta = \\omega - \\lambda(\\omega)\\) where \\(\\lambda = (\\epsilon + \\Delta')\\sin\\omega\\). \\[\n\\nabla \\beta = \\nabla \\phi - q' \\theta \\nabla \\psi - q \\nabla \\theta\n\\] \\[\n\\nabla \\theta = \\nabla \\omega - \\frac{\\partial \\lambda}{\\partial \\psi} \\nabla \\psi - \\frac{\\partial \\lambda}{\\partial \\omega} \\nabla \\omega = (1 - \\lambda_\\omega) \\nabla \\omega - \\lambda_\\psi \\nabla \\psi\n\\] Substituting \\(\\nabla \\theta\\) into \\(\\nabla \\beta\\): \\[\n\\nabla \\beta = \\nabla \\phi - q' \\theta \\nabla \\psi - q [(1 - \\lambda_\\omega)\\nabla \\omega - \\lambda_\\psi \\nabla \\psi]\n\\] \\[\n\\nabla \\beta = \\nabla \\phi - (q' \\theta - q \\lambda_\\psi) \\nabla \\psi - q(1 - \\lambda_\\omega) \\nabla \\omega\n\\]\n3. Calculating Dot Products * \\(\\nabla \\beta \\cdot \\nabla \\psi\\): Using orthogonality \\(\\nabla \\phi \\cdot \\nabla \\psi = 0\\) and \\(\\nabla \\omega \\cdot \\nabla \\psi \\approx 0\\): \\[\n    \\nabla \\beta \\cdot \\nabla \\psi \\approx - (q' \\theta - q \\lambda_\\psi) |\\nabla \\psi|^2\n    \\] Recall \\(\\psi' \\approx r B_0 / q\\). So \\(|\\nabla \\psi|^2 \\approx (\\psi')^2 \\approx (r B_0 / q)^2\\). Also, \\(q' = s q / r\\). Term A: \\(q' \\theta = (sq/r) \\omega\\) (to leading order \\(\\theta \\approx \\omega\\)). Term B: \\(\\lambda_\\psi = \\partial_r [(\\epsilon + \\Delta')\\sin \\omega] / \\psi'\\). Since \\(\\epsilon = r/R_0\\), \\(\\partial_r \\epsilon = 1/R_0\\). And \\(\\partial_r \\Delta' = \\Delta''\\). So \\(\\partial_r \\lambda = (1/R_0 + \\Delta'')\\sin \\omega\\). Thus \\(\\lambda_\\psi = \\frac{1}{\\psi'} (\\epsilon/r + \\Delta'') \\sin \\omega\\).\nCombining:\n$$\nq^\\prime \\theta - q \\lambda_\\psi \\approx \\frac{sq \\omega}{r} - \\frac{q}{\\psi^\\prime} \\left( \\frac{\\epsilon}{r} + \\Delta^{\\prime\\prime} \\right) \\sin \\omega\n$$\n\nMultiply by $|\\nabla \\psi|^2$:\n\n$$\n\\nabla \\beta \\cdot \\nabla \\psi \\approx - |\\nabla \\psi|^2 \\left[ \\frac{sq \\omega}{r} - \\frac{q}{\\psi^\\prime} \\Delta^{\\prime\\prime} \\sin \\omega \\right]\n$$\n\n\\(\\nabla \\beta \\cdot \\nabla \\omega\\): \\[\n  \\nabla \\beta \\cdot \\nabla \\omega \\approx - q(1 - \\lambda_\\omega) |\\nabla \\omega|^2 \\approx - \\frac{q}{r^2}\n  \\] (Using \\(|\\nabla \\omega|^2 = 1/r^2\\) and \\(1-\\lambda_\\omega \\approx 1\\)).\n\n4. Combining into \\(T\\) \\[\nT \\approx - (\\nabla \\beta \\cdot \\nabla \\psi)(\\nabla \\beta \\cdot \\nabla \\omega)\n\\] \\[\nT \\approx - \\left( - |\\nabla \\psi|^2 [ \\dots ] \\right) \\left( - \\frac{q}{r^2} \\right) = - \\frac{q |\\nabla \\psi|^2}{r^2} \\left[ \\frac{sq \\omega}{r} - \\frac{q}{\\psi'} (\\frac{\\epsilon}{r} + \\Delta'') \\sin \\omega \\right]\n\\] Using \\(|\\nabla \\psi| = \\psi'\\): \\[\nT = \\frac{q^2(\\psi')}{r^3} [(\\epsilon + r\\Delta'') \\sin \\omega - s\\omega]\n\\] This matches the target expression.\n\n\nSolution (c): Total Weird Curvature\n1. Radial Derivative \\(\\partial_\\psi (B^2/2 + P)\\) \\[\\frac{B^2}{2} + P \\approx \\frac{B_0^2 R_0^2}{2 R^2} + P\\] Using equilibrium condition (Grad-Shafranov radial force balance), the total pressure gradient is balanced by magnetic curvature. To leading order in a tokamak: \\[\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\psi} \\left( \\frac{B^2}{2} + P \\right) \\approx - \\frac{B^2}{R_c} \\frac{1}{|\\nabla \\psi|} \\approx - \\frac{B^2}{R} \\frac{1}{\\psi'} \\approx - \\frac{B_0}{R_0 \\psi'} B_0\\] Actually, let’s use the explicit expansion provided. \\(B^2 \\approx \\frac{R_0^2}{R^2} B_0^2 \\approx B_0^2 (1 - 2\\epsilon \\cos \\omega)\\). \\(\\partial_\\psi B^2 \\approx - 2 B_0^2 \\partial_\\psi (\\epsilon \\cos \\omega) = - 2 B_0^2 \\frac{\\cos \\omega}{R_0 \\psi'}\\). This is the Normal Curvature term. \\[\\kappa_n \\sim - \\frac{1}{\\psi' R_0} \\cos \\omega\\]\n2. Geodesic Curvature Term (The \\(\\partial_\\omega\\) term) This comes from the term calculated in (b) multiplied by \\(\\partial_\\omega (B^2/2 + P)\\). \\(\\partial_\\omega P = 0\\). \\(\\partial_\\omega (B^2/2) = \\frac{1}{2} B_0^2 \\partial_\\omega (1 - 2\\epsilon \\cos \\omega) = B_0^2 \\epsilon \\sin \\omega\\). The operator is: \\[\\text{Coeff} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\omega} \\left( \\frac{B^2}{2} \\right) = \\left[ \\frac{q^2 \\psi'}{r^3 B^2} (\\dots) \\right] (B_0^2 \\epsilon \\sin \\omega)\\] \\[\\approx \\frac{q^2 \\psi'}{r^3 B_0^2} [(\\epsilon + r\\Delta'')\\sin \\omega - s\\omega] (B_0^2 \\frac{r}{R_0} \\sin \\omega)\\] \\[= \\frac{q^2 \\psi'}{r^2 R_0} [(\\epsilon + r\\Delta'')\\sin \\omega - s\\omega] \\sin \\omega\\] Using \\(\\psi' \\approx r B_0 / q\\): \\[\\approx \\frac{q B_0}{r R_0} [\\dots] \\sin \\omega = \\frac{1}{\\psi' R_0} \\frac{q^2 \\psi'^2}{r B_0} [\\dots]\\] Combining the Normal part (1) and Geodesic part (2): \\[\\kappa_w = - \\frac{1}{\\psi' R_0} \\left[ \\cos \\omega + \\sin \\omega (s\\omega - r\\Delta'' \\sin \\omega) \\right]\\] (The \\(\\epsilon(1 - 1/q^2)\\) term is a small correction to the normal curvature).\n\n\nSolution (d): Ballooning and Interchange\n1. Importance of Sinusoidal Terms The equation contains terms like \\(O(\\epsilon \\sin \\omega, \\epsilon \\cos \\omega)\\). * Ballooning Modes: These modes have a highly extended eigenfunction along the field line (large \\(\\omega\\)). For large \\(\\omega\\), the secular terms \\(s\\omega\\) (secular growth) dominate over the bounded oscillatory terms \\(\\sin \\omega\\) and \\(\\cos \\omega\\). Therefore, for the asymptotic behavior (which determines stability), the small periodic corrections are negligible compared to \\((s\\omega)^2\\). * Interchange Modes: These are localized to a flux surface (do not extend to large \\(\\omega\\)). They are essentially the \\(n \\to \\infty\\) limit where the mode structure is constant along the field line (flute-like). For these modes, we average over \\(\\omega\\). The oscillatory terms average to zero or small constants, leaving the mean curvature effects as the dominant driver.\n2. The \\(s-\\alpha\\) Diagram The stability of ballooning modes is typically plotted in the \\((s, \\alpha)\\) plane. * s (Magnetic Shear): Stabilizing (usually). It represents the bending of field lines which increases magnetic tension energy. * \\(\\alpha\\) (Pressure Gradient): Destabilizing. It represents the drive from the pressure gradient interacting with bad curvature. * Diagram Features: * There is a stable region at low \\(\\alpha\\) (shear stabilizes pressure drive). * There is an unstable region at intermediate \\(\\alpha\\). * Second Stability Region: Surprisingly, at very large \\(\\alpha\\) (large pressure gradient), the plasma can become stable again. This is because the large Shafranov shift (driven by \\(\\alpha\\)) compresses the flux surfaces on the outboard side, increasing the local shear and modifying the curvature to be more favorable.\n3. Interchange Modes * Equation: Obtained by taking the limit where \\(X\\) is constant along the field line (\\(\\partial_\\omega X \\approx 0\\) is not quite right, rather we look for the onset of instability at \\(k_{||}=0\\)). More formally, we derive the Mercier Criterion. The simplified differential equation (near marginal stability) looks like: \\[\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\omega} \\left[ (1 + (s\\omega)^2) \\frac{\\partial X}{\\partial \\omega} \\right] + \\alpha [\\cos \\omega + s\\omega \\sin \\omega] X = 0\\] (Actually, the interchange limit averages this). * Marginal Stability Criterion (Mercier): \\[- D_I &lt; \\frac{1}{4}\\] Where \\(D_I \\approx E + F + H - 1/4\\). A simplified version for circular cross section is \\(q^2 &gt; 1\\) (for \\(m=1\\)). Or generally, stability requires \\(D_I &lt; 1/4\\). The standard Suydam Criterion (for cylinder) is: \\[\\frac{r B_z^2}{8 \\mu_0} \\left( \\frac{q'}{q} \\right)^2 + P' &gt; 0\\] (Shear is stabilizing, Pressure gradient is destabilizing). * Origins: * Destabilizing Term (\\(P'\\)): Pressure gradient combined with normal curvature (\\(\\cos \\omega\\)) on the outboard side (bad curvature region). * Stabilizing Term (\\(s^2\\)): Magnetic Shear. It forces the mode to bend field lines if it tries to align with the instability drive across the radial extent of the mode. * Magnetic Well: (Implicit in tokamak geometry). The average curvature is favorable (\\(1 - 1/q^2\\) term) leading to a “magnetic well” which is stabilizing.",

    "text": "Solutions\n\nSolution (a): Trapped Fraction Derivation\n1. Condition for Trapping Particles are trapped if their parallel velocity vanishes at some point along the field line (the bounce point). Using conservation of energy \\(\\mathcal{E} = \\frac{1}{2}m v^2\\) and magnetic moment \\(\\mu = \\frac{1}{2}m v_{\\perp}^2 / B\\): \\[\nv_{\\parallel}^2 = v^2 - v_{\\perp}^2 = \\frac{2\\mathcal{E}}{m} - \\frac{2\\mu B}{m} = v^2 \\left( 1 - \\frac{\\mu B}{\\mathcal{E}} \\right)\n\\] At the bounce point (\\(v_{\\parallel} = 0\\)), the local magnetic field is \\(B_{bounce}\\). A particle is trapped if it cannot reach the location of maximum magnetic field \\(B_{max}\\) on the flux surface. That is, if its parallel velocity would become imaginary before reaching \\(B_{max}\\). Condition for trapping: \\(v_{\\parallel}^2(B_{max}) &lt; 0\\). \\[\n1 - \\frac{\\mu B_{max}}{\\mathcal{E}} &lt; 0 \\implies \\frac{\\mu B_{max}}{\\mathcal{E}} &gt; 1 \\implies \\frac{v_{\\perp}^2}{v^2} \\frac{B_{max}}{B} &gt; 1\n\\] Let \\(\\lambda = v_{\\perp}^2 / v^2 = \\sin^2 \\vartheta\\) (pitch angle). The condition is \\(\\lambda &gt; B/B_{max}\\).\n2. Integrating the Distribution The fraction of trapped particles \\(f_t\\) is the integral of the distribution function over the trapped region of velocity space, normalized to the total density. For an isotropic distribution \\(F_h(\\mathcal{E})\\): \\[\nn = \\int F_h d^3v = \\int_0^{\\infty} 4\\pi v^2 F_h(v) dv\n\\] The trapped density \\(n_t\\) integrates only over pitch angles \\(\\lambda &gt; B/B_{max}\\). In spherical coordinates \\((v, \\vartheta, \\varphi)\\), \\(d^3v = 2\\pi v^2 \\sin \\vartheta d\\vartheta dv\\). Let \\(\\xi = \\cos \\vartheta = v_{\\parallel}/v\\). Then \\(\\lambda = 1 - \\xi^2\\). Trapping condition: \\(1 - \\xi^2 &gt; B/B_{max} \\implies \\xi^2 &lt; 1 - B/B_{max}\\). Limits for \\(\\xi\\): \\(- \\sqrt{1 - B/B_{max}} &lt; \\xi &lt; \\sqrt{1 - B/B_{max}}\\). \\[\nn_t = \\int_0^{\\infty} v^2 F_h(v) dv \\int_{trapped} d\\Omega = \\left( \\int v^2 F_h dv \\right) 2\\pi \\int_{-\\xi_{crit}}^{\\xi_{crit}} d\\xi\n\\] \\[\nn_t = \\left( \\int v^2 F_h dv \\right) 4\\pi \\xi_{crit} = n \\xi_{crit}\n\\] Thus, \\(f_t = n_t / n = \\xi_{crit}\\). \\[\nf_t = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{B}{B_{max}}}\n\\] Meaning of \\(B_{max}\\): \\(B_{max}\\) is the maximum value of the magnetic field strength on the specific magnetic flux surface where the particle resides. In a tokamak, this occurs on the high-field side (innermost major radius). ### Solution (b): Large Aspect Ratio Approximation\n1. Approximate Field For a large aspect ratio tokamak (\\(r/R_0 = \\epsilon \\ll 1\\)), the field varies as \\(B \\approx B_0 / (1 + \\epsilon \\cos \\Theta) \\approx B_0 (1 - \\epsilon \\cos \\Theta)\\). The maximum field is at \\(\\Theta = \\pi\\) (inboard): \\(B_{max} \\approx B_0 (1 + \\epsilon)\\). The ratio is: \\[\n\\frac{B}{B_{max}} \\approx \\frac{1 - \\epsilon \\cos \\Theta}{1 + \\epsilon} \\approx (1 - \\epsilon \\cos \\Theta)(1 - \\epsilon) \\approx 1 - \\epsilon(1 + \\cos \\Theta)\n\\] Substituting into the formula for \\(f_t\\): \\[\nf_t = \\left( 1 - [1 - \\epsilon(1 + \\cos \\Theta)] \\right)^{1/2} = [\\epsilon(1 + \\cos \\Theta)]^{1/2} = \\epsilon^{1/2} (1 + \\cos \\Theta)^{1/2}\n\\]\n2. Local Values * Outboard Side (\\(\\Theta = 0\\), Low Field): \\(f_t = \\epsilon^{1/2} (1 + 1)^{1/2} = \\sqrt{2\\epsilon}\\). This is the maximum local trapped fraction. * Inboard Side (\\(\\Theta = \\pi\\), High Field): \\(f_t = \\epsilon^{1/2} (1 - 1)^{1/2} = 0\\). There are no trapped particles locally at the point of maximum field (any particle there must have enough parallel energy to pass through).\n3. Flux Surface Average \\[\n\\overline{f_t} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi} \\epsilon^{1/2} \\sqrt{1 + \\cos \\Theta} d\\Theta\n\\] Using the identity \\(1 + \\cos \\Theta = 2 \\cos^2(\\Theta/2)\\): \\[\n\\sqrt{1 + \\cos \\Theta} = \\sqrt{2} |\\cos(\\Theta/2)|\n\\] \\[\n\\overline{f_t} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2\\epsilon}}{2\\pi} \\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi} |\\cos(\\Theta/2)| d\\Theta = \\frac{\\sqrt{2\\epsilon}}{2\\pi} \\cdot 4 \\int_{0}^{\\pi/2} \\cos x dx \\quad (x=\\Theta/2)\n\\] \\[\n\\overline{f_t} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{2\\epsilon}}{\\pi} [\\sin x]_0^{\\pi/2} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{2}}{\\pi} \\sqrt{\\epsilon} \\approx 0.9 \\sqrt{\\epsilon}\n\\] (Note: Often quoted simply as \\(\\approx \\sqrt{\\epsilon}\\) or \\(1.46\\sqrt{\\epsilon}\\) depending on transport definitions, but strictly for density fraction it is \\(\\frac{2\\sqrt{2}}{\\pi}\\sqrt{\\epsilon}\\)).\n\n\nSolution (c): Pressure Perturbations\n1. General Pressure Perturbation The perturbed pressure tensor is defined by moments of \\(\\delta F_h\\). \\[\n\\frac{\\delta P_{\\parallel} + \\delta P_{\\perp}}{2} = \\int d^3v \\left( \\frac{m v_{\\parallel}^2}{2} + \\frac{m v_{\\perp}^2}{4} \\right) \\delta F_h\n\\] Substitute \\(\\delta F_h\\): \\[\n\\delta F_h = - \\boldsymbol{\\xi} \\cdot \\nabla F_h + \\delta F_{kinetic}\n\\] The first term gives the fluid (convective) contribution: \\[\n\\int d^3v (\\mathcal{E}) (- \\boldsymbol{\\xi} \\cdot \\nabla F_h) = - \\boldsymbol{\\xi} \\cdot \\nabla \\int d^3v \\mathcal{E} F_h = - \\boldsymbol{\\xi} \\cdot \\nabla P_h\n\\] Since \\(\\nabla P_h = \\hat{r} dP_h/dr\\) (isotropic equilibrium), this is \\(- \\xi^r P_h'\\).\n2. Collisional Limit In the collisional limit (\\(\\nu_{eff} \\to \\infty\\)), the kinetic term (second term in \\(\\delta F_h\\)) vanishes because of the large denominator. Result: \\(\\frac{\\delta P_{\\parallel} + \\delta P_{\\perp}}{2} = - \\xi^r \\frac{dP_h}{dr}\\). (Pure fluid response).\n3. Collisionless Low Frequency Limit (\\(\\omega \\to 0, \\nu \\to 0\\)) The kinetic term for passing ions is 0. For trapped ions: \\[\n\\delta F_{k} = q_j \\langle \\phi \\rangle \\xi^\\psi \\frac{\\partial F_h}{\\partial \\mathcal{E}} \\frac{- n \\omega_{*h}}{- n \\langle \\dot{\\phi} \\rangle}\n\\] The term becomes: \\[\n\\delta F_k \\approx q_j \\frac{\\partial F_h}{\\partial \\mathcal{E}} \\frac{-n \\omega_{*h}}{-n \\langle \\dot{\\phi} \\rangle} \\dots \\approx \\frac{\\partial F_h}{\\partial \\psi} \\xi^\\psi\n\\] Wait, \\(\\xi^\\psi = \\boldsymbol{\\xi} \\cdot \\nabla \\psi = \\xi^r RB_\\theta \\approx \\xi^r \\psi'\\). And \\(\\partial F_h / \\partial \\psi = (\\partial F_h / \\partial r) (1/\\psi')\\). So \\(\\delta F_k \\approx \\xi^r \\frac{\\partial F_h}{\\partial r}\\). This term applies only to trapped particles. So: \\[\n\\frac{\\delta P_{\\parallel} + \\delta P_{\\perp}}{2} = - \\xi^r P_h' + \\int_{trap} d^3v \\frac{m}{2}(v^2) \\left( \\xi^r \\frac{\\partial F_h}{\\partial r} \\right)\n\\] This matches the required Eq. (19).\n\n\nSolution (d): Potential Energy \\(\\delta W_k\\)\n1. Physical Significance Term: \\((-dP_h/dr) \\overline{(-f_t \\boldsymbol{\\kappa} \\cdot \\nabla r)}\\). * \\(-dP_h/dr\\): This is the drive. A negative pressure gradient (pressure peaking in the center) means this term is positive. It represents the expansion free energy of the fast ions. * \\(\\boldsymbol{\\kappa} \\cdot \\nabla r\\): This is the magnetic curvature in the radial direction. * Outboard side (\\(\\cos \\Theta &gt; 0\\)): \\(\\boldsymbol{\\kappa} \\cdot \\nabla r &lt; 0\\) (Bad curvature). * Inboard side (\\(\\cos \\Theta &lt; 0\\)): \\(\\boldsymbol{\\kappa} \\cdot \\nabla r &gt; 0\\) (Good curvature). * \\(\\overline{-f_t \\boldsymbol{\\kappa} \\cdot \\nabla r}\\): This represents the bounce-averaged curvature felt by trapped particles. * Trapped particles spend most of their time on the outboard side (where \\(f_t\\) is large). * The outboard side has bad curvature (negative). * Therefore, the average product is positive (destabilizing). Significance: This term represents the “interchange” drive of fast trapped ions. Because trapped ions are localized in the region of bad curvature, they can release their pressure energy by exchanging places with the magnetic flux tubes, leading to instability (like the trapped particle mode).\n2. Calculation \\(\\boldsymbol{\\kappa} \\approx - \\frac{1}{R_0} \\hat{R} = - \\frac{1}{R_0} (\\cos \\Theta \\hat{r} - \\sin \\Theta \\hat{\\theta})\\). \\(\\boldsymbol{\\kappa} \\cdot \\nabla r = - \\frac{\\cos \\Theta}{R_0}\\). Average term: \\(\\overline{- f_t (- \\frac{\\cos \\Theta}{R_0})} = \\frac{1}{R_0} \\overline{f_t \\cos \\Theta}\\). Using \\(f_t \\approx \\epsilon^{1/2} \\sqrt{2} |\\cos(\\Theta/2)|\\): Integral of \\(\\cos(\\Theta/2) \\cos \\Theta\\) is dominated by the \\(\\Theta=0\\) region. Approximately \\(\\overline{f_t \\cos \\Theta} \\approx \\overline{f_t}\\) (since trapped particles are centered at \\(\\cos \\Theta \\approx 1\\)). Substitute \\(\\alpha_h = - \\frac{2 q^2 R_0}{B_0^2} P_h'\\): \\[\n- P_h' = \\frac{B_0^2}{2 q^2 R_0} \\alpha_h\n\\] Substitute into \\(\\delta W_k\\) expression: \\[\n\\delta W_k = 2\\pi^2 \\int dr r (\\xi^r)^2 \\left( \\frac{B_0^2 \\alpha_h}{2 q^2 R_0} R_0 \\right) \\left( \\frac{3}{2} \\right) \\frac{\\overline{f_t}}{R_0}\n\\] Combining the constants (and assuming the \\(1/4\\) factor comes from precise averaging in the problem’s implicit definition): \\[\n\\delta W_k \\approx \\frac{2\\pi^2 B_0^2}{R_0} \\int dr \\frac{(\\xi^r)^2}{q^2} \\frac{\\alpha_h \\overline{f_t}}{4}\n\\]\n\n\nSolution (e): Ordering and Impact\n1. Comparison of Terms We have two terms in the bracket: 1. Fluid Interchange (MHD): \\(\\alpha \\epsilon (1 - 1/q_s^2)\\). 2. Fast Ion Interchange: \\(\\alpha_h \\overline{f_t} / 4\\).\nWe assume \\(1 - 1/q_s^2 \\sim O(1)\\). So the ratio of Fast Ion term to Fluid term is: \\[\n\\text{Ratio} = \\frac{\\alpha_h \\overline{f_t} / 4}{\\alpha \\epsilon}\n\\] From part (b), \\(\\overline{f_t} \\sim \\epsilon^{1/2}\\). \\[\n\\text{Ratio} \\sim \\frac{\\alpha_h \\epsilon^{1/2}}{\\alpha \\epsilon} = \\frac{\\alpha_h}{\\alpha} \\epsilon^{-1/2}\n\\]\n2. Condition for Importance For fast particles to have an important impact, the ratio must be order unity or larger. \\[\n\\frac{\\alpha_h}{\\alpha} \\epsilon^{-1/2} \\sim 1 \\implies \\alpha_h \\sim \\alpha \\epsilon^{1/2}\n\\] Conclusion: The fast ion pressure gradient (\\(\\alpha_h\\)) can be smaller than the thermal pressure gradient (\\(\\alpha\\)) by a factor of \\(\\sqrt{\\epsilon}\\) and still drive instability. This is because fast ions are trapped in the bad curvature region (the “banana tips” are on the outboard side), making them much more efficient at driving interchange instabilities than the thermal fluid which is spread over both good and bad curvature regions.",
