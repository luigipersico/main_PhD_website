## Introduction
Neutral Beam Injection (NBI) is a key technique used in tokamak fusion devices to heat the plasma and drive current. In NBI systems, neutral atoms—typically hydrogen or deuterium—are accelerated to high energies and injected into the plasma. Because charged particles would be deflected by the magnetic fields in the tokamak, the ions are first neutralized before injection. Once inside the plasma, these fast neutrals transfer their energy to the plasma particles through collisions, increasing the plasma temperature and contributing to the overall performance of the fusion experiment. NBI is valued for its ability to deliver precise and controllable heating, making it an essential tool in plasma physics research and fusion reactor development.
