## Introduction

Beam Emission Spectroscopy (BES) is a diagnostic technique used in plasma physics to measure density fluctuations within a plasma. It works by injecting a neutral beam into the plasma and observing the light emitted as the beam atoms interact with plasma particles. The intensity and spatial distribution of this emission provide valuable information about the local plasma density and its fluctuations, which are important for understanding turbulence and transport phenomena in fusion devices.
