## Physical principles

When neutral particles enter in a plasma, they are subject to inelastic collisions with plasma's ions and electrons. The neutrals' electrons, which initially are in their ground state, can reach a higher energy level, $E_{2}$ and, when they decay to a lower energy state $E_{1}$, they emit a photon with energy $E_{\gamma} = E_2 - E_1$, and wavelength $\lambda = \frac{hc}{E_{\gamma}}$.

In particular, of specific interest is the Balmer-$\alpha$ emission of the deuterium atom $D_{\alpha}$, which corresponds to the transition between $n=3$ and $n=2$, and is characterized by an energy $E_{D_{\alpha}} = 1.89$ eV and a wavelength $\lambda_{D_{\alpha}} = 656.279$ nm.
